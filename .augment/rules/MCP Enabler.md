Strict Rules:
- Prefer Context7 for the Reference of Better Documentation.
- Use Sequential Thinking After Creating a Full Plan using Agent Mode to acheive more refined version of decision making. 

Pattern: 

Agent Mode Thinking > Sequential Thinking > Use Context7 On the Need Basis > Agent Mode Thinking (Finalise the Decision). 


Use Other MCP Servers on the need basis.
